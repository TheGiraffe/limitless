A game about everything and nothing.

~~For debugging, use F5 in VS Code to run.~~

Just say ```flutter run``` to run.

## TODO:
[ ] Replace all the SVG files with PNGs instead for better performance benefits!

## Build in Public
☑️ Made a masterplan document with notes and illustrations

☑️ Put that PDF into Inkscape to get SVGs of each of the illustrations

☑️ Capturing the illustration and coding process as I go

## Animations that I want to add
- Loading animations
- Shooting stars, UFOs, birds, etc in background
- Swaying plants and palm trees
- Wind blowing dust and particles
- Characters moving (character animation strips)
- Koi fish moving
- Bubbles from potions
